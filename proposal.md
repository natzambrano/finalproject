## Repository
<Link to your project's public GitHub respository>

## Description
For this project, I will be recreating the classic arcade game Pong - but with a twist! 
This game takes place in "The Fishing Pong" (instead of pond lol) where fish play tennis for fun!
This project will use the Pygame library and use images to make Pong more visually interesting, and
will serve to decompress stressed out students who need to take their mind off of homework. 


## Features
- Controls
	- Using pygame.event I will detect player input and mirror it to the pong paddles (fish).
- Images 
	- Using os from the python standard library, images can be used/displayed in the game. 
- Gameplay
	- In the game loop, score will be tracked and players will compete until a victor wins x amount of rounds. 

## Challenges
- The math behind the ball's position will require a lot of testing.
- After making the game logic, overlaying images will require additional research. 
- Keeping score, ending the game, and declaring a winner is not something we have been taught.


## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Better re-creation of pong in a new style that includes fishy element. 
Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A re-creation of Pong that doesn't include fish due to time constraints.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up controls
  2. Balls direction and bouncing 

- Week 2
  1. Reach minimal viable outcome
  2. Adding fish and background

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finish ideal outcome
  2. Run tests and work on/complete presentation
